Jekyll become pain when running on macos, some system dependencies doesn't run out of the box for me. 
This is much supported on github, where I primarly hangout.

It is also because i'm not much into ruby environmens. Ruby multiple approach to same thing doesn't resonate with me while
chossing programming language, but resonates more how I see life.

Run jekyll using docker: `docker run --rm --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" -it jekyll/jekyll:4 jekyll serve`
